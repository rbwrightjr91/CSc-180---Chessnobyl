Chessnobyl
===

Chessnobyl is an AI created for CSc 180, Intelligent Systems, at CSU Sacramento. It was created to play a custom chess variant created by our professor. The rules can be found [here](http://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~gordonvs/180/Tournaments/18Stres.html). In a class competition of 20+ programs, Chessnobyl was seeded at 3rd and placed 5th. Chessnobyl implements Minimax, Alpha Beta Pruning, Iterative Deepening, and Killer Move.
